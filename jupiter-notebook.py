# # # Jupyter Notebook is an interactive, web-based computational environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used in data science for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and documentation of data analysis workflows.

# # To create or open a Jupyter Notebook file in VS Code and connect it to your project, follow these steps:

# # Open VS Code:

# # Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.
# # Create or Open a Project Directory:

# # If you already have a project directory (e.g., MyDataScienceProject) where you plan to work on your project, open it using VS Code by selecting "File" > "Open Folder" and choosing your project directory.
# # Open or Create a Jupyter Notebook:

# # a. To create a new Jupyter Notebook:

# # In VS Code, within your project directory, click the "New File" icon (represented by a blank sheet of paper) in the top-left corner of the Explorer panel (the left sidebar).
# # Name the file with a .ipynb extension, such as exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb.

# Start Working in Jupyter Notebook:

# Double-click the Jupyter Notebook file (exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) in the VS Code Explorer panel to open it.
# Inside the Jupyter Notebook, you can create and run code cells, perform data analysis, and add text explanations as needed.
