    "- Clauses are in-built functions available to us in SQL.\n",
    "- Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL.\n",
    "- By convention clauses are written in UPPERCASE.\n",
    "- Clauses are also called commands\n",
    "- Clauses help us filter and analyze data quickly.\n",
    "- When we have large amounts of data stored in the database, we use Clauses to query and get data required by the user.\n",

    "\n",
    "* indicates we want to select all colomns. We can also select individual columns ( SELECT name FROM students )\n",

    " SQL Clauses and Keywords:\n",

    " WHERE Clause: Allows you to filter rows based on specific conditions. It is used with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to narrow down the rows affected.\n",
    "\n",
    " ORDER BY: Used to sort the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. This helps in organizing data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " GROUP BY: Empowers you to group rows based on the values in one or more columns. It is typically used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., to summarize data within each group."
